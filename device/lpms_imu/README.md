## Under Linux, non root users receive read and write access to /dev/ttyUSB0     
* Firstly, check the permissions attribute of the /dev/ttyUSB0 and enter it at the terminal:  
>`ll /dev/ttyUSB0`  

* Secondly,two method to slove this problem:    
>`sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0`  

* However, this method is one-time, pull out the console line, and then the file will be reset, so it will continue to report errors  
>`sudo usermod -aG dialout username`  

Because by default, only root users and users belonging to the dialout group will have read and write privileges, so it's OK to add your users directly to the dialout group. When you have finished the command, you need to logout it and it will take effect forever.
